About the Household Travel Survey,,,,,
,,,,,
The Household Travel Survey (HTS) is the largest and most comprehensive source of personal travel data ,,,,,
"for the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area. This area includes the Sydney Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA), ",,,,,
the Illawarra and the Lower Hunter regions. It extends from Port Stephens in the north to Shoalhaven in the south and,,,,,
the Blue Mountains in the west.,,,,,
,,,,,
"This survey is a benchmark for best practice in travel surveys in Australia and around the world, as well as being ",,,,,
the longest running continuous household travel survey in the country.  The HTS was first conducted in 1997/98,,,,,
and has been running continuously since then.,,,,,
,,,,,
"Prior to the HTS, three major one-off household travel surveys were conducted in Sydney in 1971, 1981 and 1991/92.  ",,,,,
"These had large samples (over 12,000 households) and used a face-to-face interview method.  In 1997, the HTS was ",,,,,
established to meet the needs of transport data users for more timely information.  This is conducted by collecting ,,,,,
personal travel data on a continuous basis.  The HTS uses a similar method to the 1991/92 Home Interview Survey (HIS).,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
Survey method,,,,,
,,,,,
The HTS consists of a face-to-face interview survey carried out every day from July to June of each financial year.  ,,,,,
This collection method ensures high data quality and maximises response rates.,,,,,
,,,,,
A simple travel diary is used by each householder to record the details of all travel undertaken for their nominated 24-hour ,,,,,
period.  An interviewer then interviews each householder to collect the details of each trip.  The interviewer records ,,,,,
"the mode of travel, trip purpose, start and end location, and time of departure and arrival.  Vehicle occupancy, ",,,,,
toll roads used and parking are recorded for private vehicle trips and fare type and cost for public transport trips.,,,,,
,,,,,
"Detailed socio-demographic information is also collected on the household.  This includes dwelling type, household structure ",,,,,
"and vehicle details, as well as age, gender, employment status, occupation and income of individual household members.",,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
Sample design and statistical validity,,,,,
,,,,,
The sample of the continuous HTS is designed on a three-yearly cycle so that the pooling of three years of data gives a sample size ,,,,,
"similar to that achieved in the 1991/92 HIS.  About 5,000 randomly selected households are approached each year to ",,,,,
participate in the survey.,,,,,
,,,,,
The 2012/13 trip estimates in this report are based on five years of pooled data collected from July 2007 to June 2013.,,,,,
,,,,,
The HTS sampling method was designed for BTS by the Statistical Consultancy section of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) ,,,,,
such that the relative standard error (RSE) decreases and the statistical reliability increases as more waves of data are ,,,,,
pooled (see Figure 1 below).,,,,,

Data expansion,,,,,
,,,,,
The data collected in the HTS are expanded (weighted) to estimate the travel of the population in the survey area for a given year.  ,,,,,
The survey data are weighted based on the annual Estimated Resident Population (ERP) produced by the ABS. BTS further ,,,,,
uses ABS data on households and individuals from the latest Census of Population to adjust the ERP to produce population ,,,,,
"benchmarks of residents in private dwellings only, which are then used in the weighting process. The 2012/13 HTS estimates",,,,,
are weighted based on the June 2012 ERP.,,,,,
,,,,,
,,,,,
Comparison over time,,,,,
,,,,,
RSEs associated with estimates of change between years are greater than the RSEs for each individual year.  ,,,,,
Users should therefore be careful in interpreting the significance of over time changes.,,,,,
